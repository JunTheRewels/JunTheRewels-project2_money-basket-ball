Project Title

basket-money-ball

Our models are machine learning models that uses data points to try and predict the success of an NBA player based on their college statistics. We created both a liner regression model as well as a classification model. The classification model aims to predict if a player will become a Hall of Famer or not based soley on their college statistics.
